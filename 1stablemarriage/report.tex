  \section{Results}

All test cases pass. The huge test cases take tens of seconds, but seemingly less than a minute each.

  \section{Implementation details}

We created a Man and Woman class to make some operations more convenient. Each has an ID and a preference list. In addition, a man keeps track of how many women he's proposed to, and a woman keeps track of her current husband. In this way, printing the results becomes a loop of print(woman.husband).

The main loop in our program is "while singleMen:". The first four lines all simply get items from lists. Then we either remove a man from singleMen, swap two men (remove one and add one), or leave the list as is. This loops max n^2 times, giving O(n^2).
